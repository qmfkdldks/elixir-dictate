# Elixir Metaprogramming

> After reading Metaprogramming Elixir, I wanted to use metaprogramming skill in my own way.

### Technologies
- Elixir
- Metaprogramming
- Watson Speech to Text

## Idea
The main concept is convert sound information in to an executabe code using Watson STT and Elixir Metaprogramming. Currently it will upload flac sound file then in compilation code will be generated.

Eventually this can be a tool to code dictating whatever you want.
